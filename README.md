# App

An app approach using react native in the front and rust in the back ;)

## Requirements

- jdk 8
- android snk
- android sdk

## Hints

You have to accept the licenses of android SDK.
```
cd <SDK path>/tools/bin
./sdkmanager --licenses
```

When SDK is located within `/opt` you should make it writeable.
